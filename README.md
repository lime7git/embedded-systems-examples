# embedded-systems-examples
 Backups of small projects, prototypes, drivers, tested embedded devices, sensor and microcontrollers such as STM32, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, etc. Everything wich I have done in past that and might be useful in future. Sorted better or worse :) Programmed in various programming languages and enviroments.
